              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              This past week, I had an interview with JP Morgan. I think it went
              pretty well. The only thing that bothers me is the technical interview
              I had with their engineer. Well... It wasn't very technical in my opinions.
              He only asked me several questions about my projects and my skillset.
              I was very surprised that I didn't have to answer any coding problems.
              Glassdoor interview reviews said that the technical interviews were
              very intense for them, so that's why it bothers me. Anyway, it's done,
              and I hope to hear back from them this coming week. Also, I caught up
              on with probability class this past week. I am going to have an exam
              this Tuesday, so that's good news for me.
            </p>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What's in your way?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              Program languages. I'm considering Q-drop that class because I just
              simply do not have any motivation to attend the class even. I just
              get very confused throughout the class, and a lot of my friends say the
              same thing. Also, I just don't know how this class will be anything
              useful for my career.

              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              I have two exams this coming week, probability and OOP. I'm more
              prepared for probability, but for OOP, I am worried about it. I
              heard my friends, who had taken the class in the past semesters, said
              that the exams are rather challenging. I will need to spend some good time
              to study for this exam.

            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What's my experience of the class?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              The quizzes are getting on my nerves. I usually do my quizzes on my
              phone. Several times, they give me a popup warning saying that
              I have 10 seconds left. Then, when I click "X" to close the popup
              so I can choose an answer and submit, it just submit the quiz without
              letting pick my answer even though I still have 8 seconds left. So,
              if you can take quizzes on laptop, I would highly recommend so.

              What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              My pick-of-the-week is ACM, a CS organization. I recently joined
              them this semester, and I've been making a lot of genuine connections
              there. It is pretty much a social club. We usually have programming
              contests every other week. We also always have some form of event
              every Friday. It could be a gaming night, a board game night, or a
              family dinner night. You get to meet a lot of people in CS, and some
              of them might even be in your classes!
