              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              This past week, I started on Voting Australia project. My partner
              and I were able to read in the input to our desired data structure.
              However, I changed the data structure slightly over the weekend to
              simplify the way we solve the problem. We are not finished solving it yet,
              but it should be straight forward with this data structure. Also,
              I participated in a competitive programming contest this Friday.
              It was incredibly fun. I solved 6/9 problems, which is totally not
              bad for my first contest of the year. My friends and I are planning
              on coming again next time.

              What's in your way?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              Woops, this week will test my academic stamina. I have several
              projects due, inclduding the one for OOP. I have FoCS career night
              tomorrow to attend, then career fair on Tuesday. I also have an
              interview with ATT tomorrow. I also have to go home this Friday for
              a doctor appointment, so I will miss OOP. I hope I won't miss too much
              and get far behind.

              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              Next week, I'm going finish Voting Australia strong and submit it
              preferably Wednesday night. I really need to study for my government
              exam on Thursday. I heard that it won't be too bad, but I still
              need to study to be prepared for it. I am a little bit lost in
              Probability class, so I need to read textbook to review the material
              and/or go to TAs. Then, I will be going home and enjoy the weekend!

              What's my experience of the class?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              OOP is the only class that I haven't been distracted during the lecture.
              Thanks to Prof's no eletronic policy, the class is very engaging and
              moves very quickly. One of the quiz for this week was a little bit
              glitchy, I think. I never ran out of time, but I ran out of time before
              the last question for this quiz. A lot of other people in the class
              complained, so I'm glad I was not the only one. Oh well, I know Prof
              Downing drops numerous quizzes at the end, and we also have some
              free ones.

              What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              My pick-of-the-week is Haskell. Haskell is a great functional programming
              language. I have to learn Haskell for one of my class, and I like it so far.
              The way it makes you think about a problem logically gives me a better
              thinking mentality as a programmer. You can go to learnyouahaskell.com to
              learn more.
