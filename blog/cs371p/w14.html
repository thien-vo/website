              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              This past week, I made plans to study for last exams. I will have
              3 exams on Thursday and 1 on Friday. Over the weekend, I've started
              studying for Government and Probability. So I just need to keep this up,
              and I will be good to go on exam dates. I've also signed up
              for my classes for next semester. Even though I got a pretty early
              registration date, it was rough for me to get in to the classes
              that I want to take. Registration is always a sore pain. So far,
              I've registered to take Software Engineering, again with Downing
              (YAY!), and Algorithm with Fraij (YAY AGAIN). I'm on a waitlist
              to take Big Data with Franke, but I'm pretty hopeful that I'll get
              it.

              What's in your way?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              Simply put, 4 exams this week + sleep deprivation. I am trying my
              best to get at least 5-6 hours of sleep every night, but that's
              not always possible when I'm so stressed over studying for all my exams.

              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              Since I've started studying for Government and Probability, I will need
              to get started on studying for my culture class and OOP. I've scheduled
              a time on Tuesday to study with a friend for OOP and a time on Wednesday
              with a group of friends to study for Government. I hope this will all
              pay off in the end.

              What's my experience of the class?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              The class is finishing up. I think we're pretty much on track
              to finish it by Monday or Wednesday, covering all the materials
              for the last exam. I'm hoping for some sort of review or talks about
              the exam, but I think the comprehensive review list is pretty good
              for me already.

              What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              My-pick-of-the week is MightyText. It's an application that allows
              you to text from your computer through Chrome extension or its
              web application. Here's my personal review for the app, compared to
              another one called "MySMS". There are also Pushbullet and AirDroid,
              and you can read a more professional review
              <a href="http://techdissected.com/apps-and-games/the-state-of-sms-texting-from-your-computer-on-android/">here.</a>
              <pre>
                Mighty Text
Pros:
	- Wide-range of control in additions to texting
	- Syncing photos/videos (anything taken)
	- Also manage your gallery from chrome
	- Manage apps (uninstall quickly, easily, even the ones without uninstall buttons)
	- Syncing battery (fun)
	- User-friendly, easy-to-use UI
	- Some selections of themes
	- Phone locator (help find phone in the house)
	- Can send long messages (up to 1000 words) and it will automatically separate or do whatever it needs to get the message through
Cons:
	- Most of the things stated above are mostly available for only PRO version
	- Limited platforms (Chrome extension only ?)
	- Expensive premium ($60/y or $7/m) - sometimes have promo ($3.5 for 6m)
	- Draining battery when use other features (untested)
	- 250 msg/ month on free account
	- Glitches of not sending messages on some phones

MySMS
Pros:
	- Cheap premium ($10/y)
	- Lightweight, simple and neat UI
	- Cross-platform (Windows, Android, Mac, etc)
Cons:
	- Sending "via mysms.com" for free version
	- Cut off after 160, giving error "exceeded maximum of characters"
  - No monthly limits on free account (!?)
