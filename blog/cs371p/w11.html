              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              This past week, I had an on-site interview with MaxPoint. This is
              the first on-site interview ever for me. It went really well. I was
              interview by 3 interviewers: 2 engineers and a SE manager. The first
              engineer gives me a technical problem to solve. It took me a little bit
              of thinking to work it out, but I solved it at the end. Then, he explained
              to me more of what MaxPoint does and what his team contributes to the
              company. The 2nd interviewer is the manager, and he asked me a lot of
              resume-based questions. The 3rd interviewer asked me more situational
              questions about working on projects and work ethics. It was quite intense
              for me personally, but I feel good once I've finished all 3 interviews
              in an hour and a half. On the same day, I received an email from the HR
              asking to speak with me on the next day to see if I have a preference for
              a team over the other. Some of my friends told me that I got the offer, but
              I was just still skeptical. However, the next day, she told me that all of
              the interviewers think that I would be a good part on the team, and they
              offer me an intern position in either Big Data or High Scalability team.
              I chose Big Data, and I will be starting working with them starting early
              June. I am looking forward to it.

              What's in your way?

            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              I need to start on OOP project early, because this one seems rather complex
              than all the previous ones. However, this will be the last one! Also,
              I need to start reading a book written by Zhuang-Zi for my Asian
              Religions's essay.

              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              I plan on finishing reading the book by Friday and have the essay
              finished by the end of the weekend. I also want to at least get everything
              sketched out for my OOP last project.

            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              The past week, we get to learn more about building vector and building
              more specifics method signature for taking in parameter. I specifically
              love doing the in-class exercises where Prof. Downing will tell us the
              requirements of some functions, then he will ask us to write up an implementation.
