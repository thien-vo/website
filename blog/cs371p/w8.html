              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              This past week, I had an exam in History of Religions in Asia on Wednesday.
              I definitely procrastinated in studying for the exam. I haven't been
              doing the readings for that class, so I had to read about 200 pages of
              religions readings on Monday and Tuesday. I think I did fairly well though,
              because I answered every questions on the exam fairly thoroughly. Also,
              I'm a little bit more caught up with Probability class after finishing
              two homeworks that were due Tuesday and Thursday. I also have found
              a partner for my project 3 in OOP, and we are planning to start soon
              (Hi Seth!).
            </p>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What's in your way?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              I hope that I will be a little bit productive over spring break. I
              still have a little bit more to catch up on for Probability. I have
              an assignment due Monday for Programming Languages, so I want to get that
              out of the way soon. I will also need to work on the project for OOP
              soon, so that my partner and I don't procrastinate the last few
              days after we come back from the break.

              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              I am traveling to Chicago to see my boyfriend for a week starting Tuesday!
              While I'm there, I will code (haha). This spring break isn't really a
              "break" for me. It's more like free time for me to catch up on school
              and life so that I don't get overwhelmed by them every week.
            </p>

            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What's my experience of the class?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              We didn't have class on Friday, so that was amazing of Professor Downing.
              Professor spent a lot of time talking about the project and explaining
              about specifications for the project in class. I think this way, it provides
              a lot more incentive for people to come to class. I notice that the attendance
              for the class has been consistently good for this semester. I would give all
              the credit to the way Prof Downing structure the class.

            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              My pick-of-the-week is this video below. It is a story of a North
              Korean girl who escaped from the country to find freedom.
