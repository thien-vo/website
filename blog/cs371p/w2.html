              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              Frankly, I have been very unproductive this past week. I spent most
              of my time playing video games and catching up sleep because I stayed
              up late at night to play video games. I did, however, finished a
              small project at work. I work as the student web developer for
              the school of business McCombs. This week, I simply created a class
              profile page for MBA program of McCombs. I got to play around more
              with BootStrap and it was pretty worthwhile.

              What's in your way?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              Video games and entertainment. Distraction from schoolwork. Those
              are primarily in my way. Whenever I want to avoid working on homework,
              I end up playing video games or watching Netflix. Lacking self-motivation
              is very hurting me. However, this past weekend was Lunar New Year
              and the dues date for several assignments are coming up this week,
              so I spent most of my weekend doing homework after I had celebrated
              the New Year with my family. Now I'm all fired up and I hope to keep it up.

            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              I defnitely need to finish several projects and assignments for my classes.
              So that will be my first priority. I've been looking int Laravel,
              a PHP framework. I intend to use it for my personal project, BeautyFlow,
              so I hope to get started on that this week as well.

            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What's my experience of the class?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              We spent sometimes talking about how the projects going to go. That was
              very helpful since the first project is not hard in itself, but the
              new workflow that everyone has to follow takes a while to setup. So,
              the discussion by Prof. Downing is very helpful for us to do the project.
              Also, the quiz this week reflected on the questions suggested a new
              optimization that I could possibly use for the project. So, overall,
              I really enjoy doing the daily quizzes in class for its practical purpose
              of reviewing previous lectures and project's algorithms.

              What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              My pick-of-the-week is Laravel. Even though I have not started using
              it for my project yet, I have been following tutorials to learn
              how to use this powerful open-source framework for PHP. So if you're
              learning PHP or a PHP developer like me, you should totally check
              out Laravel.
