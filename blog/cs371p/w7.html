              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              This past week, I got a lot of my assignments and midterms done.
              I had a probability exam on Tuesday, and I think I did fairly well.
              I had a paper due for my culture class on Wednesday, and I turned it
              in the night before. I spent about 6 hours studying for OOp exam.
              Out of those 6 hours, 2 of them were for making a cheat sheet. I notice
              that a lot of people use this same cheat sheet that someone posted
              on PIazza. However, I only used it as a reference to compare with mine.
              I feel like making the cheat sheet helped me review the material a lot.
              The rest of the 6 hours was a mix of studying by myself by going over
              readings and quizzes, and studying with a partner just doing a lot
              of coding samples to make sure we understand the materials. I did really
              well on the exam.

            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What's in your way?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              I have an exam in my culture class this week, and 2 assignments due
              for probability. I think we are also getting project 3 soon for OOP,
              so I'm looking forward to that.
            </p>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              I have to finish my probability homeworks, so I am going to spend
              most of the time doing that. Other than that, my coworker and I decided
              to pair up and work on some projects together. We are going to develop
              a small android game as our first exposure to mobile app development.
              Hence, this week, we are going to get comfortable with the IDE and API.

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What's my experience of the class?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              The class does not provide any review for the exam. For me, the exam
              wasn't particularly difficult, but I was expecting some sort of overview
              of the material. Professor spent the last day before the exam teaching
              us some material that could be on the exam, and even though it wasn't
              on exam, I made me feel rushed and unprepared. Other than that, everything
              else is fine.

              What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              My pick-of-the-week Coursera. I'm surprised that a lot of people
              do not know a lot of online courses platform like Coursera, Udemy,
              EdX. These platforms provide opportunities for you to obtain certifications,
              or audit courses for free. This is a great way for you to get into something
              you like without having to wait to take the class in person at the university.
