              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              This past week, I have been working on an essay for my History of
              Religion in Asia. I got to read a famous Hindu story about Ramayana,
              featuring a divine incarnation of god Vishnu as the protagonist. It
              was rather fascinating, and I finished it overnight. Also, I was
              finishing up the project for OOP which was due 10pm Thursday. I encountered
              some problem formatting everything correctly and getting a sucessful
              build on Travis. However, I was able to figure it out with the help
              of my proctor

            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              I have some problem this week working for competitive programming class.
              In class, we were working on shortest path problem. I thought I know
              it well, but when I'm actually coding it out, it gets harder than I thought.
              I realized that if I don't plan out a design for my program carefully,
              I end up spending too much time debugging through print out statements.
              I need to stop procrastinating. Although they are not due until tomorrow, Monday,
              I should have started before this weekend.

              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              This week, programming languages class will be in my way. I will have
              some assignment that try to get me to start learning Haskell. Since
              I don't have a lot of experience with functional languages, Haskell
              is just so foreign to me. I'm excited to learn new things though. Also
              I need to start reviewing my resume for the career fairs next week.

              What's my experience of the class?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              We spent time talking about exception in Java vs C++ this week. It
              is definitely an area in programming that I haven't touched a lot.
              Usually, we just handle the specific cases like if it is a null pointer, print
              out. However, I realized that exceptions would make my code more readable
              and more robust. So I need to learn more about that. Also, I was surprised
              when Prof. Downing spent an entire lecture day to allow Bloomberg to
              give us a talk. It was a great day since we get to hear from recent UT grads
              talking about working in the industry.

              What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              My pick-of-the-week is Ramayana by Narayan. If you are interested in
              learning about religion, especially religions in Asia, this book
              will tell you a fascinating story about Hindu beliefs. It is such
              a popular religious story that almost all of my Indian friends know
              about it when I mentioned it to them.
