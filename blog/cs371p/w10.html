              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              This past week, I completed my two midterms: Probability and
              Texas Government. I think I did fairly well on both of them,
               so I am pretty happy with the effort that I put into it last week.
               I also found my partner for coming OOP project, and we started
               working on it over this weekend. In fact, we are close to finish.
               I also had a technical interview with MaxPoint, and they want
               me to come to the office this coming Wednesday for the final round.
               I am so excited for it, and I need to get ready for it too.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p class="h3" style="font-weight:bold;">
              What's in your way?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              Other than OOP project, I just have some competitive programming
              homeworks and probability homework to catch up on. Then, I need
              to prepare myself for MaxPoint final round of interviews.
            </p>

              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              I plan on spending at least several hours to review projects that
              I put on my resume, so that I am well-prepared for MaxPoint. Also,
              I want to do my homework for probability by Tuesday, so I don't
              have to worry about it. No more procrastination, I promise.

              What's my experience of the class?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              We had a talk with Atlassian. I think the talk was rather long and
              too personal. The speakers were presenting the problems they encountered
              as a developer, but to be honest, most CS students have encounter
              some sort of similar problems when work in a group project anyway.
              So instead of trying to make something so typical important, I think
              the speakers could have told us more about any graduate programs
              or internship programs. They did cover it, but it was very short
              and lack details.
            </p>

              What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              My pick-of-the-week is Attack on Titan anime series. I have been
              waited for season 2 to come out for over a year. They released it
              on several networks on April's Fool day. I thought it was a joke,
              but I was so happy that it wasn't!
