              What did you do this past week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              I finished Australia Voting with my partner on Wednesday. We subbmitted
              the project the same night. It was just a relief. The project didn't take
              us very long to finish. We spent only about 2-3 hours working on
              a Hackerrank solution. I never implemented a "simple solution" to start
              with. To me, implementing the most naive solution would have taken us
              longer. Anyway, submission went through smoothly as soon as we got a
              good build on Travis. I have much more experience working with Travis
              this time compared to the last time, so we didn't have a lot of trouble.
              I also went to the career fair and talked to numerous companies. I applied
              to a lot of them for Software Development Intern position or similar positions.
              I got several campus interview this coming week, and I'm excited for that.

              What's in your way?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              Haskell. It is for my programming languages class. I'm considering dropping
              the class since I don't think it's very helpful for me at all, yet it's
              taking up a lot of my time for other classes. We have an assignment due Monday.
              I'm planning on staying in the class until after midterm to see where I stand.
              Also, I have two probability assignments both due on Thursday, so I have to get
              started on that soon.

              What will you do next week?
            </p>
            <p  style="text-indent:35px;">
              This coming week, I'm going to work on probability most of the time. I also
              will focus on my personal projects and reviewing for technical interviews. I
              didn't do so well on some technical interviews last term, so I plan on ace it
              this semester.

              What's my experience of the class?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              I still have no complaint about the class other than the pesky daily
              quizzes (UGH!It gets frustrating sometimes). Oh, I think for this project,
              the correctness part was too easy. I didn't feel challenged on hackerrank at all.
              I wish that Professor Downing will add more requirements and/or tweak the problem
              to make it harder.

              What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the week?
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:35px;">
              My tip-of-the-week is that you should ask recruiters for their business cards
              and/or contact information. Sometimes, they told you that they will reach out
              to you via your contact information on resume, but something happened and you
              slipped through. You can contact them to ask them about the opporunity again
              or any other questions pertain to such position. I found that very helpful.
